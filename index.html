                    <p class="mt-4 lead">Quitting smoking may seem difficult or impossible—but it’s not. Traditional quitting methods have poor success rates, with doctor's advice working for only 2 out of 100 people and nicotine gums or patches working for just 6 to 8 out of 100 people.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The truth is that willpower alone fails 96% of the time because addiction isn't logical; it's psychological.</p>

                  <p class="lead">We use proven techniques like <em>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</em>, <em>Mindfulness</em>, and <em>Trigger Management</em>. These methods have much higher success rates because they address the psychological addiction that nicotine substitutes often don't.</p>

            <p>We’ve been smokers. We know the cycle — the promises, the guilt, the “last cigarette” that never really is.
            That’s why we created Smoksha: a 7-day program that helps you break free, not with patches or gimmicks, but by rewiring how your mind sees smoking.
            It’s not just quitting. It’s your final Smoke Moksha — the liberation begins here!</p>
